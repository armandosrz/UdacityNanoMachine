| [Boston Housing](/boston_housing) |  Model Evaluation & Validation | Predicting Boston housing prices using a regression model |
| [Student Intervention](/student_intervention)| Supervised Learning | Build a student intervention system using classification. Predict if a student will fail the class|
| [Customer Segments](/customer_segments) | Unsupervised| Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis. |
