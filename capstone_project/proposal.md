#Curse of Dimensionality research

During the course we learned that the curse of Dimensionality is a bad
thing, so we gotta look into reducing the dimensions into an optimal
in order to reach better results.

However, the question arise in terms of knowing the ambiguity defined
into the lack of determination into when this kind of dimension reduction
have to be performed (e.x. a specific number) and the value of the
trade off in terms of efficiency against correctness. Have big is the
gain in performance and how different dimensions reductions impact performance.
